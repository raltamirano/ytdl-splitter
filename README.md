# ytdl-splitter
Utility to download youtube videos as separate audio files, using the tracklist provided on the description of the video, and maybe other sources.

## Usage

  `nodejs index.js <video_url>`


## Notes

As this package depends on 'youtube-dl' and 'avconv', check for their requirements also. Currently, they are: the 'youtube-dl' and 'avconv' executables in your PATH, ready to be executed. Python (2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+) maybe needed in order to properly run 'youtube-dl'.
